# Enterprise Security Assessment – SME Case Study

## Overview

This project is based on a case study where I analyzed the security situation of a small-to-medium healthcare company that handled sensitive patient data.

The goal was to understand how to evaluate a company’s security posture, identify risks, and suggest realistic improvements.

## Understanding the Situation

The company was managing sensitive healthcare information but did not have strong security structure in place.

Some of the main weaknesses were:

- No clear access control structure  
- Limited monitoring of systems  
- No defined incident response plan  
- Weak backup and recovery planning  

This meant the company was exposed to risks such as data breaches, ransomware, and operational downtime.

---

## Risk Analysis

I identified potential threats such as:

- Unauthorized access to sensitive data  
- Malware or ransomware attacks  
- Data loss due to system failure  
- Lack of visibility into suspicious activity  

The risks were evaluated based on how likely they were to happen and how serious the impact would be for the company.

## Proposed Improvements

To improve the security posture, I suggested:

- Role-based access control to limit who can access what  
- Network segmentation to reduce attack surface  
- Centralized authentication and better user management  
- Implementation of logging and monitoring systems  

The idea was to build layered security rather than relying on one single control.

## Logging and Monitoring

I proposed collecting logs centrally and monitoring authentication attempts and unusual activity.

This would allow the company to detect suspicious behavior earlier instead of reacting only after damage is done.

---

## Incident Response

A simple structured incident response process was defined:

1. Detect the issue  
2. Contain the threat  
3. Remove the cause  
4. Recover systems  
5. Review what happened  

This ensures incidents are handled in an organized way.

---

## Backup and Recovery

To reduce the risk of data loss, I proposed:

- Regular automated backups  
- Secure off-site storage  
- Periodic testing of recovery procedures  

This ensures business continuity even if systems fail or are attacked.

## What I Learned

Through this case study, I learned how to think about security from an organizational perspective, not just technical controls.
It helped me understand how risk assessment, monitoring, incident response, and backups all work together to protect a business.
